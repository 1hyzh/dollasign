# dollasign
a tool to test your antivirus

# how to use:
### download it and execute as administrator, unless it won't work.
### wait until there is an explrer window automatically opened, then you can see an identifier (random string stored in C:\key_identifier.inll)
### to decrypt all of the files that been encrypted either you can:
### input the hardcoded panic key (dolla$ign44 is the default one)
### or you can use the speciffic key (the identifier encoded in base64)

# what does it do?

### it encrypts all the files accessble in the users folder, Program Files, Program Files(x86) in base64
### has a built in decryptor so when it ended the encryption you can decrypt the files.

# DISCLAIMER
### I made this tool to test the security of systems, i do not take responsibility if you don't use it for testing security.
